# imageRecognitionVOC2012
Image classiffication (multi-label) on VOC2012 Dataset.

In this work, a series of deep learning models have been developed for image classification using the [**Pascal Visual Object Challenge 2012 (VOC2012)**](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/). This dataset contains images representing one or more objects, including people, animals, vehicles, and household items.

The adopted approach consists of training a CNN from scratch, exploring the self-supervised learning paradigm, and adapting pre-trained deep neural models such as ResNet50, VGG16, and MobileNet.
